# Asynchronicity in Node.js 🚀

A comprehensive learning repository demonstrating **6 different approaches** to handling asynchronous operations in Node.js.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

This repository teaches you how to handle asynchronous operations in Node.js through a practical example: **reading a markdown file, converting it to HTML, and saving it to a database**. You'll see the same workflow implemented using different async patterns, from basic callbacks to modern `async`/`await`.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand:
- The evolution of async patterns in JavaScript/Node.js
- How to handle errors in different async approaches
- The pros and cons of each pattern
- When to use each approach in real-world applications
- How to avoid "callback hell" and write cleaner async code

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd async-in-node
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Examples

Each approach can be run independently. Navigate to the project root and run:

```bash
# Approach 1: Callbacks
node approaches/1-callbacks.js

# Approach 1b: Refactored Callbacks
node approaches/1b-callbacks-refactored.js

# Approach 2: Promises
node approaches/2-promises.js

# Approach 3: Promise.all (Parallel)
node approaches/3-promise-all.js

# Approach 4: async/await
node approaches/4-async-await.js

# Approach 4b: async/await with Promise.all
node approaches/4b-async-await-promise-all.js
```

## 📖 The Six Approaches Explained

### 1. Callbacks (`1-callbacks.js`)
**The Traditional Way**
- Uses nested callback functions
- Prone to "callback hell" with deep nesting
- Error handling with callback pattern
- **Best for**: Understanding the fundamentals

### 1b. Refactored Callbacks (`1b-callbacks-refactored.js`)
**Cleaner Callback Pattern**
- Same functionality as approach 1, but with better structure
- Demonstrates how to avoid deep nesting
- **Best for**: Learning callback best practices

### 2. Promises (`2-promises.js`)
**The Bridge to Modern Async**
- Uses Promise chains with `.then()` and `.catch()`
- Cleaner error handling
- Avoids callback hell
- **Best for**: Understanding Promise fundamentals

### 3. `Promise.all()` (`3-promise-all.js`)
**Parallel Execution**
- Runs multiple async operations simultaneously
- Faster execution when operations are independent
- All-or-nothing error handling
- **Best for**: When you need parallel processing

### 4. `async`/`await` (`4-async-await.js`)
**The Modern Standard**
- Cleanest, most readable syntax
- Synchronous-looking asynchronous code
- Easy error handling with `try`/`catch`
- **Best for**: Most modern applications

### 4b. `async`/`await` + `Promise.all()` (`4b-async-await-promise-all.js`)
**Best of Both Worlds**
- Modern syntax with parallel execution
- Combines readability of `async`/`await` with speed of `Promise.all()`
- **Best for**: High-performance applications

## 🔧 The Example Workflow

Each approach implements the same three-step process:

1. **Connect to Database** - Simulated database connection
2. **Read Markdown File** - Read and parse a markdown blog post
3. **Save to Database** - Store the processed HTML in the database

## 🧪 Mock Components

### Mock Database (`mocks/db.js`)
- Simulates real database operations with timeouts
- Provides `connect()` and `create()` methods
- Includes error simulation capabilities

### Sample Content (`blog-posts/`)
- Contains a simple markdown file for processing
- Demonstrates file system operations

## 💡 Key Learning Points

### Error Handling Evolution
- **Callbacks**: Error-first callback pattern
- **Promises**: `.catch()` method
- **`async`/`await`**: `try`/`catch` blocks

### Performance Considerations
- **Sequential**: Operations run one after another
- **Parallel**: Operations run simultaneously (where possible)
- **When to use each**: Depends on data dependencies

### Code Readability
- **Callbacks**: Can become nested and hard to read
- **Promises**: Better than callbacks, but can still chain
- **`async`/`await`**: Most readable, looks like synchronous code
